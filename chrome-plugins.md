Install extensions:

   - github dark 2.0: very nice
     https://userstyles.org/styles/128271/github-dark-2-0
   - the original github dark, which isn't as nice for github
     itself but has several themes for code:
     https://userstyles.org/styles/128271/github-dark
 - octotree
   - use ctl-shift-s to activate (or just click the > at top left)
 - json viewer awesome
 - lastpass
 - ublock origin
 - FF: Fuzzy finder for Chrome tabs and windows
   - type ff SPC in the address bar to use
   - note that you can go to the start of an address and type ff SPC
     even after you've started typing normally (this was an issue with
     some other plugins I used)
